Version 1 moiré-pattern: This uses lines and circles that are offest and top layer rotates. Not exactly the moiré pattern I was looking for, but it's interesting.

Version 2 moiré-pattern-triangles: This uses a bottom layer grid of triangles and the top layer is the same grid but rotates and undulates left to right and back. A bit cooler and slightly closer to what I was looking for but still not quite there.

Version 3 moiré-pattern-magnetometer: The actual Star Trek style moiré pattern that is affected by the magnetometer. This is a fun and cool looking sketch!

HARDWARE:
Adafruit Clue. If you don't have one, you will have to make changes to the display and magnetometer sensor yourself.
I've made them as customizable as I could. There are two layers; layer 1 (bottom) is the base "grid" and those parameters are customizable. Layer 2 (top) is also customizable but this is affected by the magnetometer. As you move around, the center point of Layer 2 moves in relation to the earth's magnetic field OR as a magnet comes close to the sensor.

Feel free to Fork the F*ck out of it! Enjoy!
