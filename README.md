There are three files here you can play with...
one uses lines and circles that are offest and top layer rotates.
the second uses a bottom layer grid of triangles and the top layer is the same grid but rotates and undulates left to right and back.
The third is an actual moir√© pattern (star trek style) that is affected by the magnetometer. This is a fun and cool looking sketch!
This is for the Adafruit Clue, so if you don't have one, you will have to make those changes yourself.
I've made them as customizable as I could. There are two layers; layer 1 is the base "grid" and those parameters are customizable and Layer 2 as well.
Here are the main things you can change:
Color Definitions -----
Parameters for the Polar Dot Grid (Bottom Layer) -----
Bottom Grid Offset -----
Top Grid Control Parameters (for the polar grid) -----
Bottom Grid Rotation Parameter ---- The bottom grid will rotate in the opposite direction.
Parameters for Radial Lines Background -----

Feel free to do your thing and Fork it! Enjoy!
