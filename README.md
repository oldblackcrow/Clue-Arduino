This is as close as I can get to creating a Moir√© pattern.
This is for the Adafruit Clue, so if you don't have one, you will have to make those changes yourself.
I've made this as customizable as I could. There are two layers; layer 1 is the base "grid" and those parameters are customizable and Layer 2 as well.
Here are the main things you can change:
Color Definitions -----
Parameters for the Polar Dot Grid (Bottom Layer) -----
Bottom Grid Offset -----
Top Grid Control Parameters (for the polar grid) -----
Bottom Grid Rotation Parameter ---- The bottom grid will rotate in the opposite direction.
Parameters for Radial Lines Background -----

Feel free to do your thing and Fork it! Enjoy!
